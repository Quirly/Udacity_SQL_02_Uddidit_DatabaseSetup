# Udacity_SQL_02_Uddidit_DatabaseSetup

This project was the second one in my Udacity SQL Nanodegree. It is about a not well-thought database schema of Uddidit, a social news aggregator. The task was 
to redesign the old database schemas and to migrate the data, adding some analytics functionality, to a new database schema (designed by me) and then migrate the data to the new schema.
